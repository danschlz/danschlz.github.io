At one point in time I thought understanding human bias was really important and made this list of mental models.

**Occam’s Taser**

The most painful explanation is usually the correct one.

**Hanlon’s Razor**

Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by carelessness. (related: _fundamental attribution error_ — the tendency for people to place an undue emphasis on internal characteristics of the agent (character or intention), rather than external factors, in explaining another person’s behavior in a given situation)

**Occam’s Razor**

Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. (related: _conjunction fallacy (Linda problem), overfitting_ — when you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras)

**Cognitive Biases**

Tendencies to think in certain ways that can lead to systematic deviations from a standard of rationality or good judgements. [List of cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)

**Planning Fallacy**

Predictions about how much time will be needed to complete a future task display an optimism bias—we think things will go perfectly well vs. averagely well.

**Hofstadter’s Law**

It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.

**Illusory Superiority**

People’s tendency to overestimate their abilities in relation to the same qualities and abilities of other people.

**Arguing from First Principles**

A first principle is a basic, foundational, self-evident proposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption. (related: dimensionality reduction; orthogonality; “Reasonable minds can disagree” if underlying premises differ)

**Proximate vs Root (Ultimate) Cause**

A proximate cause in an event which is closest to, or immediately responsible for causing, some observed result. This exists in contrast to a higher-level ultimate cause (or distal cause) which is usually thought of as the ‘real’ reason something occurred. (related: 5 whys — “to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question ‘Why?’)

**Conjunction Fallacy**

Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.

Which is more probable: Linda is a bank teller OR Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement?

**Straw Man Argument**

*   A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent.
*   A straw man is employed when one side of an argument creates a false narrative and then argues with that, instead of the point a person actually made. "I think the iPhone is actually okay" turns into "Android sucks” and discussion falls apart.

**Steel Man Argument**

*   The "steel man" is the opposite approach. As writer Robin Sloan explains, the steel man requires a debater to find the best form of her opponent's argument and then argue with this. Explain what you think your opponent means to them, ask them if they agree this is what they mean, and then argue with that.

**Pareto Efficiency**

*   A state of allocation of resources from which it is impossible to reallocate so as to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off.
*   The pareto frontier is the set of all Pareto efficient allocations, shown graphically.
*   The Prisoner’s Dilemma is a coordination problem because the sole Nash equilibrium of Defect / Defect isn’t Pareto-optimal; there’s an outcome, Cooperate / Cooperate, that both players prefer, but aren’t reaching.

**Nash Equilibrium**

*   When no player has an incentive to deviate from his chosen strategy after considering an opponent’s choice.
*   The Nash equilibrium in the prisoner’s dilemma is for both players to betray each other. Even though mutual cooperation leads to a better outcome, if one prisoner chooses mutual and the other does not, one prisoner’s outcome is worse.

**Goodhart’s Law**

*   When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.
*   Common when individuals try to anticipate the effect of a policy and then take actions which alter its outcome.

**Reflexivity**

*   Circular relationships between cause and effect, especially as embedded in human belief structures.
*   bidirectional with both the cause and the effect affecting one another in a relationship in which neither can be assigned as causes or effects.
*   Used in economics by George Soros with influence from Karl Popper.

**Schelling Point**

*   A solution that people will tend to use in the absence of communication, because it seems natural, special, or relevant to them.

**Reasoning**

Given that "if A is true then that would cause B, C, and D to be true”

*   _Deductive:_ ”A is true therefore we can deduce that B, C, and D are true".
*   _Inductive:_ "B, C, and D are observed to be true therefore A might be true". A is a reasonable explanation for B, C, and D being true.

Inductive example

1. All of the swans we have seen are white.
2. Therefore, all swans are white. (Or more precisely, "We expect that all swans are white”)

Inductive reasoning is also known as hypothesis construction because any conclusions made are based on current knowledge and predictions.

The universal theories of science were in no need of justification by sense observation or anything else. In Popper’s estimation, the important issue was not the source of theories, but their critical examination and testing — a theory is wrong because it is false and not because of where it came from. Induction was “superfluous,” and the justification of a principle of induction therefore unnecessary.
