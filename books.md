- [Profile of Raj Chetty in The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/08/raj-chettys-american-dream/592804/)
  - "Chetty has found that opportunity does not correlate with many traditional economic measures, such as employment or wage growth. In the search for opportunity’s cause, he is instead focusing on an idea borrowed from sociology: social capital. The term refers broadly to the set of connections that ease a person’s way through the world, providing support and inspiration and opening doors."
- [Profile of Richard Posner in the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/12/10/the-bench-burner)
  - "As one of the founders of the law-and-economics movement in the nineteen-seventies, he had promoted the idea that laws should be evaluated for their consequences—economic and otherwise—as much as for their fairness, and that judges should not deliberate over rights and duties in the abstract but figure out what kind of incentives their rulings were putting in place. Now that law and economics has become part of the legal establishment, it does not seem strange when Posner talks in his opinions about markets as well as precedent. More recently, he has taken up what, in the hands of gentler souls like the philosopher Richard Rorty, is the tolerant anti-doctrine of pragmatism, and made it the underpinning for his career as a flamboyantly candid judicial activist."
- [On Agnes Callard in the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/21/the-art-of-decision-making)
  - "Suppose that you sign up for a classical-music-appreciation class, in which your first assignment is to listen to a symphony. You put on headphones, press Play—and fall asleep. The problem is that you don’t actually want to listen to classical music; you just want to want to. Aspiring, Callard thinks, is a common human activity: there are aspiring wine lovers, art appreciators, sports fans, fashionistas, d.j.s, executives, alpinists, do-gooders, parents, and religious believers, all hatching plans to value new things. Many ordinary decisions, moreover—such as choosing between Goldman Sachs and Partners in Health—also touch on the question of who we aspire to become."
- [Scott Sumner, "What do we mean by meaning?"](https://www.themoneyillusion.com/what-do-we-mean-by-meaning/)
  - Perhaps the answer to the meaning of life that I agree with most. "For me, the greatest meaning in life comes from art, broadly defined to include aesthetically beautiful experiences with nature, old cities, and scientific fields like astronomy and physics.  The most meaningful experience in my life might have been seeing the film 2001 at age 13."
- [Paul Graham, "What Charisma Is"](http://www.paulgraham.com/recharisma.html)
  - As Knausgaard observes, "Charisma is one of the two great transcendental forces in the social world: beauty is the other."
- [Scott Alexander, "1960: The Year The Singularity Was Cancelled"](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/04/22/1960-the-year-the-singularity-was-cancelled/)
  - "Around 1960, doubling times stopped decreasing. The economy kept growing. But now it grows at a flat rate. It shows no signs of reaching infinity; not soon, not ever. Just constant, boring 2% GDP growth for the rest of time. Why?"
- [Scott Alexander Reviews Whyte's "Hoover: An Extraordinary Life in Extraordinary Times](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/17/book-review-hoover/)
  - Take this description on Hoover's Wikipedia page, "Though he managed somewhat to rehabilitate his legacy, Hoover is still widely regarded as an inadequate U.S. president, and most polls of historians and political scientists rank him in the bottom third overall." Scott (through Whyte) shows that Hoover was actually quite extraordinary and is in fact underrated.
- [Scott Alexander, "Archipelago and Atomic Communitarianism"](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism)
  - "If people want to go do their own thing in a way that harms no one else, you let them. That’s the Archipelagian way."
- [Scott Alexander, "How the West was won](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/25/how-the-west-was-won/)
  - "My own value system might not be objectively the best, or even very good, but it’s my value system and I want to keep it and you can’t take it away from me. I am an individualist and I think of this on an individual level, but I could also see having this self-preservation-against-optimality urge for my community and its values."
- [Tyler Cowen, Deconstruncting cultural codes](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/12/deconstructing-cultural-codes.html)
  - "I’ve long been convinced that “matters of culture” are central for understanding economic growth, but I’m also painfully aware these theories tend to lack rigor and even trying to define culture can waste people’s time for hours, with no satisfactory resolution."
