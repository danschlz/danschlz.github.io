Sometimes I cringe at beliefs I've held in the past, and I think it's both comforting and important that [this will continue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-history_illusion). There's something beautiful in the idea that the "end of history" is an illusion, and that the world and the people in it will all be much different tomorrow.

**People and ideas:** At some point in my life, I gave a lot of thought to these people and their ideas:

* Peter Thiel ([Mimesis](http://www.imitatio.org/); [technological progress as a moral imperative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsXFwy6gG_4))
* Richard Feynman ([Curiosity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmTmGLzPVyM); [sense of awe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36GT2zI8lVA))
* Friedrich Hayek ([Cultural evolution](https://www.docdroid.net/n8mk5H9/the-three-sources-of-human-values-pdf); [the use of knowledge in society](http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html))
* Karl Popper ([Critical rationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_rationalism); [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance))
* Nassim Taleb ([Antifragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility); [optionality](https://25iq.com/2013/10/13/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-nassim-taleb-about-optionalityinvesting/))
* Naval Ravikant ([Autodidacticism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmBoU93TRlo); [life fulfillment](https://youtu.be/X7tnoR6a-8A))
